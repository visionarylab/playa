Playa is a **digital audio files player** for desktop, developed using web technologies inside the [Electron][electron] framework.

It is my reconciliation with development after a long break, since I devoted my time to learn music. Why have I chosen such an anachronistic project, in this era of streamable eternal present?

Because I am an avid collector of digital music (as much as I am [of physical one][discogs]), and I spent a considerable amount of temporal and mental resources in order to organise it. I like to enjoy things I care for.

On this website I want to share my train of thought and the solutions I found to the problems I am encountering, rather than merely promoting a piece of software that I do not intend to earn my living on. Unless somebody is willing to sponsor me of course.

## Life before Playa

My favourite Windows player (after [Winamp][winamp] of course) was [foobar2000][foobar].

![The mythical foobar2000](http://www.fooblog2000.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/foobar-feb14-conf-anim.gif)

Unlike most of the then competitors, one of the available mods showed the files grouped in albums, next to the artwork. This visual detail meant a lot to me, because I was transitioning from party playlists and single songs to appreciating full LPs and discographies of bands.

As I transitioned to Mac hardware, I realised there was no OS X port of foobar. How sad! I tried to emulate it through Wine, but the overhead and the frequent crashed made me desist and fallback to other solutions such as [Cog][cog]. All the available options were either too bloated or too minimal.

Around 2009 I gave Spotify a chance. It looked like black magic to me back then, such a big catalog without having to rely on my external disk all the time. But there wasn't _everything_, and I didn't want to switch between many apps for such a vital task.

My final pick was [Vox][vox], the best no-frills player. But guess what? No simple group-by-albums. Yes it has the Collections feature, but you need to import all the files manually, plus it is closed source and so not tweakable.

Tired of dragging folders from my NAS, I decided to do the dirty work. From scratch.

## Electron

I had the idea countless times before. Java, Java FX (...), Flash, Objective C. I was either missing the focus, the will, the knowledge. It was about 2015 when I've read of a runtime that allowed a **Chromium instance** and a **node.js backend** to be wrapped and shipped together. I could use the web technologies I already mastered to build a desktop app, finally with a decent UI (Swing, I am looking at you).

I started fiddling with [Electron][electron] in no time, first implementing a CMS for static generated websites. I even did using an [electron based editor][atom]. I liked it. I felt it was the moment to start.

Like many others I guess, I like to give silly names to my projects. The aforementioned CMS was called Vaneella, because it handle a set of plain (_vanilla_) text files. I wanted my player to be real badass, a true P L A Y A H. I took a step back, I noticed the joyful iberic wordplay and I sticked to that.

It was a chance to learn this React thing everybody was talking about. The `JSX` syntax nailed it, as it allowed to write the UI in a familiar, declarative way.

The waveform background in the playback bar! The artwork from Discogs! The last.fm scrobbles! The playlist tabs! Ah, THE TRACKS AUTOMAGICALLY GROUPED BY FREAKING ALBUM.

## Vamos a la Playa ([oh, oh oh oh oh][righeira])

I felt like the first iteration had lost momentum. The tech stack looked a bit old, like all stacks older than a couple of weeks nowadays I must say. Many design choices looked questionable. Almost no test coverage. And the biggest deal: I wanted to index my collection, but I had no vision how to include such feature in the application.

I tackled the problem from a different angle. What if I organised everything _beforehand_, so that the app would just reflect such order, instead of developing for a blurred usecase?

A little digression on how I organised my music folders of the years. At the very beginning there was God, and he or she or it created the world, the animals, the light, and Napster. And he or she or it told the first humans to use it sparsely because without broadband connection (that he or she or it forgot to create initially) it took biblical ages to download even a single song.

TL;DR I was young and happy and without full albums to sort, apart from those I directly ripped from my friends.

When I started to pile up more stuff, I sinned. I sorted it by _genre_. It looked cool. Subgenres too. Problem is that genres are not a [partition][partition] of music, i.e. they overlap. And filesystem does not. And what about those bands with diverse discographies?

One morning I ditched all my precious, nonsensical subnormal subfolders for the aseptic and ascetic _alphabetical order_. I could not browse anymore by `[Shoegaze - Dreampop - Indie - Noise]` or by `[Electro - Industrial - EBM - Future Pop]`, but I felt like I did the right thing.

What about the album folders? I slowly normalised them to `year - title`, e.g. `1991 - Just for a Day`. Some bands had a plethora of singles or bootlegs, and I couldn't easily find the main releases. Time for a real discography partition now.

I took [rateyourmusic][rym] as a model. Every artist page there shows their releases grouped as _albums_, _EPs_, _compilations_ or _singles_. RYM is one of my best friends. It introduced me to soooo much good music. It really shaped my taste, so I trusted it blind.

After a very slow and at times painful process, my music collection now looks like:

```bash
Music
  A  
    ...
    Alice in Chains
      [Album]
        1990 - Facelift
        1992 - Dirt
        ...
      [Bootleg / Unauthorized]
        ...
      [Compilation]
        ...
      [EP]
        1992 - Sap
        1994 - Jar of Flies
      [Single]
        1992 - Angry Chair
        1992 - Down In A Hole
        ...
```

Why am I sure? Because I checked with a script that every folder matches such structure, and I import all further media to respect the structure. I sacrificed all non music material such as booklets, covers, cue files, etc...as I never cared much over the years.

NOW I could import all my music, using the folder names as the single source of truth!
