This week I focused mostly on testing.

## End to end testing

I am fairly new to e2e, as I usually limited myself to the domain of unit and integration.
Electron is a fairly new technology and a lot of practices are yet to settle as mature.

I had to choose between [testcafe][testcafe] and [spectron][spectron]. I gave the in-house solution a try first.

```javascript
const Application = require('spectron').Application;
const electronPath = require('electron');
const path = require('path');
const { populateTestDB } = require('./utils');

const TEN_SECONDS = 10000;

describe('Application launch', () => {
  let app;
  beforeEach(async () => {
    await populateTestDB();
    app = new Application({
      path: electronPath,
      env: { RUNNING_IN_SPECTRON: '1' },
      args: [path.join(__dirname, '..')]
    });
    return app.start();
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    if (app && app.isRunning()) {
      return app.stop();
    }
  });

  it('recalls last opened playlist', async () => {
    await app.client.waitUntilWindowLoaded();
    await app.client.click('.playlist-list .playlist-list-item');
    await app.client.waitUntil(async() => await app.client.getText('h1') === 'New Playlist 1');
    await app.restart();
    await app.client.waitUntilWindowLoaded();
    expect(await app.client.getText('h1')).toBe('New Playlist 1');
  }, TEN_SECONDS);
});
```
