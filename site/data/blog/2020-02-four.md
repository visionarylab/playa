This week I focused mostly on testing.

I left Rome for Berlin in 2012. It was at the end of a relatively short yet extremely intense and devouring relationship that developed throughout Paris, the eternal city and the lovely Alban Hills. I was 28. She was 20. I can think about this move as the watershed of my life, but now I can see how I was silently preparing myself to leave town in the previous years. I started working as a web developer while finishing my studies, and for a brief period I lived downtown in Rome. The stress of the city, of compiling the thesis and working piled up.
